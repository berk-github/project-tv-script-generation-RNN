# project-tv-script-generation-RNN

Project Overview
This project is based on the TV Script Generation repository for the Udacity Deep Learning NanoDegree.

It generates its own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs and a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from season 9. The RNN generates a "fake" TV script. It doesn't have to be grammatically correct or it doesn't have to make sense.
