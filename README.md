# project-tv-script-generation-RNN

Project Overview
This project is based on the TV Script Generation repo for the Udacity Deep Learning NanoDegree.

It generates its own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs and a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new, "fake" TV script.
